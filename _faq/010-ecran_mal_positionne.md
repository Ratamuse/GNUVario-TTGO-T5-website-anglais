description: E-Paper screen improperly positioned in the case
---

The E-Paper screen is glued to the double-sided tape on the PCB on TTGO T5.
It happens that the screen is stuck crookedly with the construction; it is possible to peel it off using a small fine cutter, and to reposition it. You can put a little alcohol on the blade to dissolve the glue.

**WARNING**. The screen is very thin and very fragile; it can be easily broken during this operation. In particular, do not put pressure on the screen with the cutter.
