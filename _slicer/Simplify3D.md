The print quality of your case will strongly depend on the settings you apply to your slicer software.

The main three are:
- [Cura](https://ultimaker.com/fr/software)
- [Repetier](https://www.repetier.com/)
- [Simplify3D](https://www.simplify3d.com/)

Here we give settings that work rather well with Simplify3D on a Geeetech A20M printer.
You can adapt them to your printer by modifying settings such as the distance and speed of retraction, size of the plate etc.
