Once your file has been loaded into simplify3d, you will be able to change the profile settings to optimize printing.

**Onglet "Extrudeuse":** 


The distance and speed of retraction will depend on your printer. The vertical retraction elevator allows the nozzle to be lifted a little after a retraction and thus avoid touching the part during a movement.


{% include slicerimg.md name="Bottom 2.jpg" %}

**Onglet "Couche"**

For this part, 0.2mm layers are a good compromise between speed and print quality. With a first layer height of 150%, the first layer will be 0.3mm. A speed of 20% compared to the overall printing speed allows good grip, in particular screw and strap turns.


{% include slicerimg.md name="Bottom 3.jpg" %}

**Onglet "Addition"**

Adding a skirt around the case, just to purge the nozzle.



{% include slicerimg.md name="Bottom 4.jpg" %}

**Onglet  "Remplissage":**

Choice of 40% material and a honeycomb filling.


{% include slicerimg.md name="Bottom 5.jpg" %}

**Onglet "Support"**

Not necessary for this case. You can uncheck the box.

{% include slicerimg.md name="Bottom 6.jpg" %}

**Onglet "Température"**

Here you set the extrusion temperature of the PLA (Shared Heater, here 215 ° C) and the temperature of the heating plate (Heated Bed, here 60 ° C)

{% include slicerimg.md name="Bottom 7.jpg" %}

**Onglet "Refroidissement"**

With PLA, leave the default values: first layer without fan, next layer, fan at 100%.


{% include slicerimg.md name="Bottom 8.jpg" %}

**Onglet "G-Code"**

If you wish to use the downloadable profile at the top of the page, you can here modify the characteristics of your printer (Cartesian, delta, printing volume, etc.)


{% include slicerimg.md name="Bottom 9.jpg" %}

**Onglet "Scripts"**

Keep your printer's default scripts.


{% include slicerimg.md name="Bottom 10.jpg" %}

**Onglet "Vitesse"**

The printing speed depends on the mechanical quality of your printer. At 60mm / s there should be no problems.

{% include slicerimg.md name="Bottom 11.jpg" %}

**Onglet "Autre"**

Adjust the size of your filament, price, density ....


{% include slicerimg.md name="Bottom 12.jpg" %}

**Onglet "Avancés"**

Thin wall behavior: leave "Perimeter only" and "Allow filling of spaces".
