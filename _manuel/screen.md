The time and the Duration of the flight are displayed alternately, the time is indicated with an "h" (12:36) and the duration with ":" (05:21).
When the flight duration is less than 1 hour the indication is "min: sec".
After 1 hour flight we have "hour: min".

The glide ratio and the sink rate can be configured to have only one information of your choice or both alternately

The up / down indication arrow gives integrated information on associated X sec at the sink rate.

Several indications are possible for the "GPS status" icon.
