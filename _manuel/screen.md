{%include manuelimg.md name="ecran291.svg"%}

**First screen**

Waiting GPS location

|                                  |        	    |		{%include manuelimg.md name="GPSresearch.svg"%}

GPS location is fixed, waiting flight start. Number of bars proportional to the GPS signal quality.

|                                  |        	     |		{%include manuelimg.md name="GPSfixed.svg"%}

Flight recording (manual by pressing the left button or automatic depending on your settings).

|                                  |     		    |		{%include manuelimg.md name="GPSrecording.svg"%}
	

The other icons indicate the volume level, the battery status and if bluetooth is activated.

1/Altitude (sea level) and AGL (ground level) are displayed alternately. Be sure to have downloaded your AGL data for your area in the SDcard AGL folder.

2/The up/down indication arrow gives integrated information on associated X sec at the sink rate.

3/The time and the flight time are displayed alternately, the time is indicated with an "h" (12:36) and the flight time with ":" (05:21).
When the flight duration is less than 1 hour the indication is "min: sec".
After 1 hour flight we have "hour: min".

4/The glide ratio and the sink rate can be configured to have only one information of your choice or both alternately.

5/Without GPS location and/or when your speed is lower than 5 km/h, the displayed heading is the magnetic heading (like a compass). With GPS and when your speed is higher than 5km/h, the heading is the direction of your movement.
