Here are some soldering tips before you start building the variometer.

First **always check the placement of the component after soldering the first pin**. Once two pins of the component are soldered, it becomes very difficult to move or unsolder it. So always weld in three steps:

1. Solder just **one** pin

{% include tutoimg.md name="stip2.JPG" %}

2. Check the component position. If this does not seem good, heat the solder again while replacing it.

3. When the placement is perfect, you can solder the other pins.

After **do not hesitate to heat the solder sufficiently**. The components used are not very sensitive to temperature. And making a good quality weld is crucial. I recommend soldering each pin in two steps:

1. Just apply a small amount of solder to make the contact between the two parts.
2. Reheat the solder **at least 2 seconds** before applying the correct amount of solder.
