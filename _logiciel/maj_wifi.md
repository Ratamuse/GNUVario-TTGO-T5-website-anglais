The Gnuvario firmware can be updated in Wifi mode; either by downloading it directly from the Internet, or by downloading it from the computer.

To do this, you must start the vario in Wifi mode; see['manual']({{site.baseurl}}/manuel/wifi.html)

You must choose the 'Update' menu; the web page will indicate the current version, and offer an update, either online or locally:

### Web Update

Two possible options: install a beta version (development version), or a stable version.
Click on the desired option; the firmware will then be automatically downloaded from the Internet to the vario.
Once the download is complete, the Gnuvario will update, then restart with the new version.

**Note:** the pages of the embedded website (located on the SD card, folder /www) are also updated during this operation.

### Local update

You must select the firmware file by clicking on the 'browse' button; then download it on the vario by clicking on the 'Send' button.
The Gnuvario will update from this file, then restart.

**Please note:** during this operation, only the Gnuvario firmware is updated.
Then think about manually updating the /www folder on the SD card.
